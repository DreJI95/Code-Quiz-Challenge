# Code-Quiz-Challenge
#Andre Moseley

**Description:** 
This application will allow a user to test their knowledge on JavasScript fundamentals and compare their scores when completed. Using HTML, CSS and Javascript I built a timer and multiple choice questions that will store the user's score to their local storage.

**User Story**
- AS A coding boot camp student
- I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
- SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

**Acceptance Criteria**
- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initials and score
